# Master thesis project idea

## Description
My idea for my master thesis is to make a screen mirroring tool. The point of
this program is to be able to mirror i.e. your phone screen to you computer 
and vice versa. This could also work between two computers. The plan is to 
make the program completely remote, similar to applications like TeamViewer.
This program won't make you able to interact with the mirrored device from 
the other device, you will only be able to see the other persons screen.

I am unsure of what technologies I will be using for this, but I belive that
I will use the programming languages C or C++, and possibly Python. The 
program that I will use is Visual Studio Code.
